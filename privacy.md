## Privacy Policy

<em>Last Updated: 2016-08-23</em>

pnut.io and its related services are a very unsophisticated hobby project by one person. While it may change in the future, we will give at least six (6) weeks notice before any changes to this policy. The privacy policy is maintained <a href="https://github.com/pnut-api/tos">on GitHub</a>, where you can see any changes.



### Information You Provide to Us

We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, subscribe, participate in any interactive features of our services, fill out a form, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your email address and other contact or identifying information you choose to provide.



### Information We Collect

When you access or use our services, we automatically collect some basic information about you, such as IP address, time, browser, and operating system you self-report as using. Common log-type records are periodically removed.



### Use

We do not use your information except to provide you services directly and improve those services, including, for example, a partner developer who is more capable than we are.

By accessing and using our services, you consent to the processing and transfer of your information in and to the United States and other countries.



### Sharing

We do not have ads or third party companies involved in data, development, or other parts of The Service. It's a hobby project. We may share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.



### Security

pnut.io is not a professional organization. We take reasonable measures to help protect personal information as we are able.



### Account Information

You may update, correct, or delete information about yourself at any time by logging into your online account and modifying your personal profile, or by API calls. If you wish to delete or suspend your account, please E-mail us, but note that we may retain cached or archived copies of your information for a certain period of time. We will attempt to properly clean up after you leave, though times and IDs for your posts and user are left.

#### Cookies

We use cookies as insignificant helpers, and you may block them without concern.

#### Promotional Communications

We have no plans for promotional E-mails, but they're definitely possible in the future. You may opt out of receiving them by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt out, we may still send you E-mails about your account changes.



### Contact Us

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@pnut.io">support@pnut.io</a>.
